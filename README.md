# Mapping-the-moral-compass-tool
COMPGC02 Web App Design
Mapping the Moral Compass is a web application which helps measure in-house lawyersâ€™
attitude to ethics. Our client, Prof. Richard Moorhead, is an academic at the UCL
Department of Laws and envisaged to make a contribution to academic research in the field
of law. The idea behind the project was to distribute a survey on ethics to in-house lawyers,
collect their responses and calculate a personal score for each respondent by comparing
their answers against an existing database. Existing survey platforms such as qualtrics.com
were not sophisticated enough to be able to handle these requirements sufficiently, which
is why the Mapping the Moral Compass project was created.
Our solution was to create an intelligent back-end platform consisting of MySQL as the
database management system, as well as PHP to handle the server-side. We used the
existing database that Prof. Moorhead provided us with as the foundation against which we
could perform score calculations. We then built a survey on top of this which allowed us to
collect additional responses and add them to the database. We protected access to the
survey by a password chosen by Prof. Moorhead to ensure that he can control who may or
may not participate in the survey.
